# Spring-Framework

In this repo, I have created a set of classes to teach or learn the basic fundamentals of Spring Core. The Spring Core module is a fundamental part of the Spring Framework, providing a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.

To help users get started with Spring Core, I have created classes that cover several core concepts, including autowiring, constructor injection, setter injection, SpEL (Spring Expression Language), standalone, and stereotype. Each class provides a detailed explanation of its respective topic and includes examples to help users understand how to apply these concepts in their own projects.

Autowiring allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into a bean, while constructor injection and setter injection provide different ways to manually inject dependencies into a bean. SpEL allows developers to define expressions to be evaluated at runtime, providing a powerful tool for dynamic configuration. Standalone classes are self-contained components that do not rely on the Spring Framework, while stereotypes are annotations that can be used to group beans together.

Overall, these classes provide a comprehensive introduction to Spring Core and its key concepts, making it easy for developers to get started with Spring and leverage its powerful features in their own projects.
